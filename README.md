This web platform not only allows the user to run the rainfall runoff model in a user friendly environment, but also provides the handy calibration support by suggesting parameters set after Li and Lu (2014), hydrograph visualization and calculating Nash Efficiency value.

Main advantages of the model

Web-based Xinanjiang model with calibration support system was designed, implemented. This system has been developed as a symbiosis between ICT and hydrology with the objective of satisfying social requirements. In addition, it is extremely useful for hydrologists and researchers who will perform parameter calibration in order to simulate the hydrological behavior of their study basin as closely as possible. Currently, this application has been used by some of the lab members for their research related to calibration of Xinanjiang model. From user's point of view, calibration process can do directly at anywhere, anytime where internet accessibility is available with minimum effort without any technical software for hydrological model. This fact is major advantage of this system.

Keeping the previous record of users is also another advantage. Saving simulation results with parameter value files on the server provides system users flexibility for comparing different parameter value with same input dataset. A user may check the record of previously completed model simulations for a particular study area. 

Another advantage of this model is the user-friendly Internet-based interface. Even though separate modules were used to execute the model and view the results, those modules were linked through a graphic user interface (GUI).The interface provides access to all functions via buttons and interactive user input screens. So users can comfortably run the model and use the modeling results. In addition, it brings complicated model to its users (who are not necessarily modelers) with easily understandable terms, graphs and tables. 

Last advantage of this system is integration of web-based model with some useful functions such as suggesting suitable data adjusted parameter value to users in considering for reducing time consuming. Additionally, providing calculated NASH and RMSE value is also helpful to users in deciding how much users inputted parameter value can represent accuracy of model. Consequently, analyzing graphs with good visualization can improve when users adjust parameter value.

In conclusion, web-based Xinanjiang model with calibration support system is really useful and reliable system for hydrologists, researchers and students to do calibration for their study basins as it offers a flexible and user-friendly environment with some functions.
